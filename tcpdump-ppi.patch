    Subject: [tcpdump-workers] Printing PPI packets
    
    Printing PPI packets with tcpdump does not turn out
    to be that hard.
    
    My simple tests have produced the output as below.
    
    It would be worthwhile having some changes made into
    the tcpdump code base that were similar to the attached
    that print them out.
